Convert set of strings in number as given on phone keypad. String will contain only lower case characters. Print these strings with numbers in descending order of numbers, if numbers are same then lexicographical order of strings.
Input: amazon, rat,pat
Output: 262966 amazon
728 pat
728 rat

In a M*N maze you can move in any direction(left,right,up,down). There are bomb on some positions. Starting from (0,0) find the number of moves require to exit from the maze. Exit point is (m-1,n-1). If its not possible then return -1. Similar to Minesweeper Game.

Given coin array and a sum K, find min. number of required coin to make sum K.



KMP for pattern searching

Reverse every k-element in a linked list(algo+code)

1. Given 2 string , find whether 2nd is sub-string of 1st or not. (it would be great if you solve with KMP)

3. Given list of coins with various values (unlimited coins of each type) , find how many ways you can make a given value. (DP was expected.) Since it was not guaranteed that coin of value 1 would be present , we have to return -1 if the given value is not possible.

1) Find whether given LinkedList is Palindrome or not



1. Given an array, output an array where every index conains nearest greatest element to that element on right side.

3. Find first non-repeating character in String
ex: geeksforgeeks: f
geeksforgeeksFirst:o


round 1
1. Next Greater Element in array
3. Find the row with maximum no of 1s in 2-D sorted array


written
1. A string consists of parentheses and letters. Write a program to validate all the parentheses. Ignore the letters.
eg. ((alf)ls) – valid
)(dkk)() – invalid

2. You are involved in a betting game whose rules are as follows :
a) if you win a round, the bet amount will be added to your sum and next bet amount will be $1;
b) if you lose a round, the bet amount will be reduced from your total sum and next bet will be twice the previous.
c) game ends when all the rounds are complete or you dont have sufficient sum.
Initially, you are given with a string of the form “WLWWL” where W indicates a win and L indicates a loss and initial sum. Initial bet amount will be $1.

Function prototypes and main was given for both questions.

Discussion : I gave two approaches one with DFS and other with level order traversal.
He asked to compare two approaches and implement the efficient one. DFS is the efficient one because in level order, you need to store all the nodes at each level, some of them may not be a part of the left view of BT.



Q2: Given a random node address in Singly linked list. Delete that node.
You need to write full code in language of any choice with all the edge cases covered.
